		DicomEditor is a stand-alone DICOM viewer, DICOM image editor,
		and general MIRC anonymizer that supports supports both DICOM images
		and XML metadata files. Each type of file is processed by a separate
		anonymizer that is controlled by its own script file. The DICOM
		anonymizer scripts can be edited directly as described in "The DICOM Anonymizer
		Tab" below. The XML anonymizer script must be constructed separately
		as described in the "The XML Anonymizer" below.
		<p>On a Windows machine, you can run it by double-clicking it or by
		launching a command window, navigating to the DicomEditor directory,
		and typing:
		<center><code>java -jar DicomEditor.jar</code></center>
		<p>If the anonymizer reports errors that are not obvious from the
		results reported in the Results pane, you may get additional information
		by running it under a command window.

		<h2>The Directory Tab</h2>
		The Directory tab allows navigation through the files on the computer.
		<p>The pulldown menu in the upper right of the Directory pane allows
		selection of the file system root that will be displayed in the
		directory tree.
		<p>The button in the lower right of the Directory pane displays a dialog
		that allows selection of the file extensions which will be displayed
		in the directory tree. If the list of extensions includes an asterisk,
		all files will be displayed.
		<p>The Anonymize button starts the anonymization
		process. Which files are processed depends on whether a file or a directory is selected
		in the tree and on whether the Include Subdirectories checkbox
		is selected:
		<ul>
		<li>If a single file is selected, that file is processed.</li>
		<li>If a directory is selected and the Include Subdirectories checkbox is
		not selected, all the files in the selected directory are processed, but no
		files in subdirectories are processed.</li>
		<li>If a directory is selected and the Include Subdirectories checkbox is
		selected, all the files in the selected directory and all its subdirectories
		are processed.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The Change Names of Anonymized Files checkbox determines whether the anonymization
		process modifies the file or instead creates a new file with "-no-phi" appended to the name.
		<p>If Change Names of Anonymized Files is selected, the anonymizer will not anonymize
		files whose names end in "-no-phi". To anonymize those files, you must deselect the checkbox.
		<p>If Change Names of Anonymized Files is selected AND Use SOPIUID for name is selected,
		the anonymizer will not use the "-no-phi" suffix, but will instead rename the anonymized
		file to the SOP Instance UID of the anonymized object.
		<p>If Force IVR-LE syntax is checked, the transfer syntax of the anonymized file is forced to
		implicit VR little endian.
		<p>If UseSOPIUID for name is checked, anonymized DICOM files will be named to
		their SOPInstanceUID values followed by ".dcm".
		<p><b>Important Note:</b> The program anonymizes in the event thread, so
		there is no way to stop it while it is running except to kill the program. Thus, you
		should be careful when selecting the Include Subdirectories checkbox.
		<p>Events that occur during the anonymization process are logged in the Results pane.
		<p> The Fix DICOM button works on the same set of files as the Anonymize button, but instead of
		anonymization, it only corrects any elements in the DICOM object which have incorrect VRs. If
		Force IVR-LE syntax is selected, it also forces the transfer syntax. This function always
		overwrites the original file, and renaming is not performed.
		<p>If you are testing with a central remapper, click the Set Remapper URL button and set its URL, then click the Enable remote remapper box. This box is not selectable unless there is a non-blank value in the URL.

		<h2>The DICOM Viewer Tab</h2>
		The DICOM Viewer tab displays a DICOM image along with its metadata. Certain elements in the
		metadata (most of the ones that are textual) are editable.
		<p>To open a DICOM file, click on the Open button and use the file chooser to navigate to the
		desired file. The file chooser will point to the same directory that is currently open
		in the Directory tab unless you have an image open in the viewer and have navigated to a different
		directory.
		<p>To close the currently open image, click the Close button.
		<p>To edit an element, click on its (group,element) designation. A dialog box will appear
		allowing you to change the value of the element.
		<p>If you have changed an element, the Save and Save All buttons will be enabled. Save only saves the
		changes made to the current image. Save All applies the changes to all the
		images with the same StudyInstanceUID in the current directory.
		<p>An element designation displayed in red is one that could cause the anonymizer to call its quarantine
		function and leave the image untouched. If you anonymize an image and the Results pane shows that
		the anonymizer called the
		quarantine function, look at the values in the red elements and see if there is something wrong.
		<p>To save a JPEG version of the currently displayed image, click the Save As JPEG button. A dialog
		box will appear allowing you to specify the maximum width of the saved image. The actual width of the
		saved image will be the minimum of the width of the DICOM image and the maximum width you specify.
		The height will be scaled to maintain the aspect ratio.

		<h2>The DICOM Anonymizer Tab</h2>
		The DICOM Anonymizer tab displays the DICOM anonymizer scripts. You can edit the scripts and click the Save button.
		Changes are not effective until the scripts are saved. If you make a change and decide you made an error
		before saving, click the Reset button and the scripts will be refreshed from the last saved version.
		<p>The script functions are documented in "How to Configure the Anonymizer for MIRC Clinical Trial Services",
		which is available on the RSNA MIRC site (http://mirc.rsna.org). Click the Downloads link in the header and
		scroll down to the list of documents for administrators.
		<p>The following is a list of the functions for quick reference:
		<ul>
		<li>@contents(ElementName)</li>
		<li>@contents(ElementName,"regex")</li>
		<li>@contents(ElementName,"regex","replacement")</li>

		</ul>
		The keyword <b>this</b> may be used in place of an ElementName to
		indicate the element whose replacement is being constructed.

		<h2>The XML Anonymizer</h2>
		The XML anonymizer is driven by a script file called "xml-anonymizer.script" located in
		the same directory where the DicomEditor program is stored. This file is not delivered
		as part of the installation, so you must construct it yourself using any text editor
		(e.g., TextPad). Because XML is very general, the script language is different from
		that of the DICOM anonymizer. It is also different in order to make it look XPath-like
		for the benefit of XSL wizards.

		<p>The following is a quick reference for the scripting language. There are three types
		of commands. Each starts on the first character of a line. Each
		is indicated by a specific starting character. A line not starting with one of the three
		command-start characters is appended to the preceeding line.

		<ul>
		<li>Any line starting with a '#' character is a comment line.</li>
		<li>A line starting with an identifier is an assignment command. An identifier always starts
		with a '$' and is immediately followed by a name, for example, "$UID".</li>
		<li>A line starting with a '/' character is a path assignment command. Paths are XPath-like
		expressions, always starting from the root element.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here are some examples of paths:
		<ul>
		<li>/MIRCdocument/authorization/owner refers the "owner" child element of an authorization
		element in an XML document whose root element is "MIRCdocument".</li>
		<li>/MIRCdocument/@display refers to the "display" attribute of an XML document whose
		root element is "MIRCdocument".</li>
		<li>/*/* refers to any second-generation child element of an XML document, no matter what
		its root element is named.</li>
		<li>/*//owner refers to any "owner" element in an XML document, no matter what its root
		element is named.</li>
		<li>/message/segment[3] refers to the fourth (always count from zero) "segment" element in an
		XML document whose root element is "message".
		</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If no bracketed qualifier is present in a path segment, the first element matching the
		segment name is selected. If all elements matching the segment name are to be selected, use
		the "[*]" wildcard qualifier, e.g. /root/element[*].

		<p>Assignment statements are of two types:
		<ul>
		<li>$name = expression</li>
		<li>/path = expression</li>
		</ul>
		In a $name assignment, an expression can be any combination of literals
		(quoted strings, e.g. "some text"), paths, and other names. For an path
		assignment,an expression can be any combination of literals,
		paths, names, or function calls. There are three functions:
		<ul>
		<li>$require( <em>expression</em> ) forces the creation of the element or attribute
		identified by the path on the left side of the assignment, including all necessary
		parent elements. The value assigned to the element or attribute is the value
		of expression argument of the $require function.</li>
		<li>$remove() causes the element or attribute identified by the path on the left
		side of the assignment to be removed from the document.</li>
		<li>$uid( <em>expression</em> ) causes the value of the element to be remapped
		using the value of the expression as the new UID's root. The UID remapping function
		uses the same UID remapping table as is used by the DICOM anonymizer, allowing
		UIDs to be remapped while preserving the relationships between DICOM and XML objects.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here is an example script for remapping UIDs of two different types in XML
		files whose root elements are called LidcReadMessage:
		<pre>
		$UIDROOT = "1.2.3.4"
		/LidcReadMessage/ResponseHeader/SeriesInstanceUid = $uid($UIDROOT)
		/LidcReadMessage//imageSOP_UID = $uid($UIDROOT)
		</pre>
		Here is an example script for doing the same work as above but at the same
		time renaming the "SeriesInstanceUid" element to "SeriesInstanceUID":
		<pre>
		$UIDROOT = "1.2.3.4"
		/LidcReadMessage/ResponseHeader/SeriesInstanceUid = $uid($UIDROOT)
		$temp = /LidcReadMessage/ResponseHeader/SeriesInstanceUid
		/LidcReadMessage/ResponseHeader/SeriesInstanceUID = $require($temp)
		/LidcReadMessage/ResponseHeader/SeriesInstanceUid = $remove()
		/LidcReadMessage//imageSOP_UID = $uid($UIDROOT)
		</pre>
		To assist in debugging XML anonymizer scripts, there is a special name assignment
		command:
		<pre>
		$print = <em>expression</em>
		</pre>
		This causes the value of the expression to be printed on the console. If you are running
		DicomEditor on a Windows system and want to use this feature, you should launch the program
		from a command window as described at the top of this page.

		<h2>The Encryption Key</h2>
		The re-identification system which is part of the anonymizer encrypts
		the keys in its database to make it more difficult for a hacker to acquire
		protected health information. The encryption key is a string of text that
		can be thought of as a password. You have the option to define your own key
		or to use a default key that is stored in the program. A good key is about
		20 characters long, not counting any spaces.
		<p>
		When the program starts, if it finds an existing re-identification database
		it checks to see whether the key to the database is the default. If it is not,
		it prompts the user for the key.
		<p>
		If your system is on a secure network, then using the default key may be
		more convenient, since the prompt is suppressed. If your system is in a
		less secure place, you should define your own key the first time the program
		is run. Once the key for a database is defined, it cannot be changed. To
		start a new re-identification database, you must remove the idtable.properties
		file from the DicomEditor directory and restart the program, causing it to
		create a new database and request a key the next time it runs.
